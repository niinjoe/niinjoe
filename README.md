- 👋 Hi, I’m @niinjoe
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and make my own apps and websites.
- 🌱 I dominate python, html & css. Most of my day to day is working with python either creating reports or learning new libraries and skills.
- 💞️ My goal is to build my own websites and automate tasks. And some day even manage my own business with all this knowledge.
- 📫 How to reach me: @niinjoe on twitter
